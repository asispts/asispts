    <h2>About Me</h2>
  </summary>

  Back in 2006, I began my programming journey by learning `Pascal` and `Visual Basic`.
  Then, I got good at `PHP` and made websites for my first clients.
  I also learned `Xojo`, a.k.a `RealBASIC`, as another way to make programs like `Visual Basic`.

  In 2012, I began my career as a Remote Software Engineer.
  I worked for a company in Italy, making apps that worked on `Windows`, `Linux`, and `macOS` using `Xojo`.
  During this time, I also did freelance work for companies in Europe and Asia.

  After a few years, I transitioned to become a Full-stack Web Developer, utilizing `CodeIgniter` and `Symfony`.
  I further expanded my expertise in backend development with a strong focus on `Symfony`.
  I also worked on several project using `WordPress`, `Laravel`, and frontend frameworks like `React` and `Vue`.

  Looking ahead, my plan is to expand my skills further by learning and developing mobile apps as well.
