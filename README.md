# Hi there! :wave:

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm ***Asis***, and this is where I showcase my personal projects.


## About Me

Back in 2006, I began my programming journey by learning `Pascal` and `Visual Basic`.
Later on, I gained proficiency in `PHP` and built several websites for my very first clients.
I also became proficient in `Xojo`, previously known as `RealBASIC`, as an alternative to `Visual Basic`.

In 2012, I started my career as a Software Engineer, specializing in cross-platform desktop development.
During this time, I created several applications for `Windows`, `Linux`, and `macOS` using `Xojo`.
After a few years, I transitioned to become a Full-stack Web Developer, utilizing `CodeIgniter` and `Symfony`.
I further expanded my expertise in backend development with a strong focus on `Symfony`.
I also worked on several project using `WordPress`, `Laravel`, and frontend frameworks like `React` and `Vue`.

Overall, I have gained expertise in various programming languages and frameworks, allowing me to handle both backend and frontend projects effectively.
