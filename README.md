## :star2: About me
A seasoned Backend/Full-stack Developer who used to work as a Cross-Platform Desktop Developer.

<details>
  <summary>:train2: My Journey</summary>

  Here's a glimpse of my learning journey:
  - 2005: Started my coding journey with `Pascal` and `Visual Basic`.
  - 2007: Began learning `REALBAsic` (a.k.a `Xojo`), diving into cross-platform desktop development.
  - 2008: Learned `PHP` and built my first website for a client in 2009.

  In 2012, I began my career as a Remote Software Engineer.
  I worked for a company in Italy, developing apps for `Windows`, `Linux`, and `macOS` using `Xojo`.
  I also worked as a freelancer for several companies in Europe and Asia.

  After a few years, I transitioned to become a Full-stack Web Developer, primarily using CodeIgniter and Symfony.
  I further expanded my expertise in backend development, with a strong focus on Symfony Framework.
  I also gained experience with WordPress, Laravel, and various frontend frameworks for different projects.

  Looking ahead, I want to dive into mobile development as well.
