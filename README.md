# Hi there! :wave:

Over a decade ago, I started my journey in cross-platform desktop development using `Xojo` and later transitioned to full-stack web development. I have expertise in backend development, particularly with `Symfony`, but I also work with `Laravel`, `WordPress`, `Slim`, `React`, and `Vue.js`. I'm currently exploring `Express.js` and `NestJS`.


## Contributions

In addition to my personal projects, I contribute to open source projects through [@pts-contrib](https://github.com/pts-contrib) account.

If you're interested in exploring more of my work, you can check out the following accounts:
- [@pattisahusiwa](https://github.com/pattisahusiwa): My old account.
- [@pts-contrib](https://github.com/pts-contrib): Account for open source project contributions.
- [@pts-tpl](https://github.com/pts-tpl): Account for storing HTML templates that I create in my spare time.


## Freelancing and Consulting

I'm available for freelance work and consulting, preferably remote.
If you have any projects or ideas you'd like to discuss, feel free to reach out. You can connect with me through [email](mailto:asispts@gmail.com) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/asispts).
